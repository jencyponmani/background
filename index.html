		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
		<br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
		when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br>
		It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
		remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <br>
		containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker<br> 
		including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
		Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br>
		It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <br>
		Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, <br>
		looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, <br>
		and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <br>
		Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" <br>
		(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. <br>
		This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br>
		The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br>
        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.<br> 
		Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,<br>
		accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.<br>
